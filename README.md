# Warper
<p>A PCB camera designed to be circuit bent on the fly! For Hack Club's highway event.</p>

<p>Cirucit bending is the manipulation of a circuit (typically instruments or cameras) to produce effects not intended by the manufacturer. I guess what I'm making isn't actually circuit bending then, cause I intend for my camera to produce unique effects. The Warper is going to be a small, PCB camera with all sorts of buttons and dials that can be played with to produce cool visual effects. The main camera will include a flash, a digital viewfinder and the ability to store images to an SD card, as well as a ton of options to glitch out your photo!</p>
